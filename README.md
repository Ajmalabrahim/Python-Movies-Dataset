# Python-Movies-Dataset
In this project I will go through a movies.csv file. I will familiarize myself with the data before I clean it, and then
I will create visuals of the correlation between variables. 
The goal of this project is to get familiar with python syntax, functions, clean data, make visuals, and share results.
